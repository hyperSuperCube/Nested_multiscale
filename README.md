# Nested_multiscale

This is a Finite difference solve for nested multiscale problem
This solver uses MAC grid layout to prevent checkbord pressure issue
This solver supports both the second and fourth order discretization
The mesh supports rectangular box from 1D to 3D with uniform discretization
Boundary condition suppports Dirichlet / Nuemann / Robin / Periodic
Boundary condition can be a function of both location and time
